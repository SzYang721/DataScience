    "- **Question 5.2**: Please figure out which parts of Gaussian distribution have parameters when taking the logarithm.\n",

    "- **Question 5.6**: Students should always know where the activation comes from and express the derivative of logistic sigmoid function in terms of the sigmoid function itself.\n",

    "- **Question 5.15**: Use the symmetry between backpropagation and forward propagation.\n",
    "\n",

    "Autograd is a reverse automatic differentiation system. Conceptually, autograd records a graph recording all of the operations that created the data as you execute operations, giving you a directed acyclic graph whose leaves are the input tensors and roots are the output tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Easy-to-understand Analogy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are a baker, and you have a recipe for a cake that involves several ingredients, such as flour, sugar, eggs, and butter. You want to know how much each ingredient contributes to the final taste of the cake, so you decide to experiment by changing the amount of each ingredient and tasting the cake afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep track of the changes you make to the recipe and their effect on the taste of the cake, you write down each step and its corresponding result in a notebook. For example, you might write \"added 100g of sugar, cake tasted sweeter\" or \"reduced flour by 50g, cake tasted less dense\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Autograd works in a similar way, by keeping track of the operations performed on tensors (which are like the ingredients in our recipe) and their corresponding gradients (which are like the taste of the cake).
